
Complete Pin Connections for ESP32-CAM Dustbin Automation

1. Servo Motor Connections

| Servo Motor   | Signal GPIO Pin | Power            | Ground             |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Servo 1       | GPIO12          | External 5V      | Common Ground (GND)|
| Servo 2       | GPIO13          | External 5V      | Common Ground (GND)|
| Servo 3       | GPIO14          | External 5V      | Common Ground (GND)|
| Servo 4       | GPIO15          | External 5V      | Common Ground (GND)|

Important Notes:
- Use an external 5V power supply for the servos to avoid overloading the ESP32-CAM.
- Connect the servo GND to both the ESP32-CAM GND and the external power supply GND for a common ground.

2. ESP32-CAM Pin Connections

Power and Communication:
| Pin Name      | Function              | Connection                                      |
|---------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 5V            | Power Input           | Connect to a 5V source (USB-to-Serial or external). |
| GND           | Ground                | Common ground for all components.              |
| GPIO0         | Boot Mode Selection   | Connect to GND during programming. Leave unconnected for normal operation. |
| GPIO1         | TX (UART)             | Connect to RX of USB-to-Serial adapter for programming. |
| GPIO3         | RX (UART)             | Connect to TX of USB-to-Serial adapter for programming. |

3. Camera Module Connections

The ESP32-CAM has predefined pins for the camera module. Ensure the camera is firmly attached to the slot on the ESP32-CAM board.

| Signal         | GPIO Pin |
|-----------------|----------|
| XCLK           | GPIO0    |
| PCLK           | GPIO22   |
| VSYNC          | GPIO25   |
| HREF           | GPIO23   |
| D0             | GPIO5    |
| D1             | GPIO18   |
| D2             | GPIO19   |
| D3             | GPIO21   |
| D4             | GPIO36   |
| D5             | GPIO39   |
| D6             | GPIO34   |
| D7             | GPIO35   |
| SDA            | GPIO26   |
| SCL            | GPIO27   |

4. USB-to-Serial Adapter Connections (for Programming)

| USB-to-Serial Pin | ESP32-CAM Pin |
|--------------------|---------------|
| TX                 | GPIO3 (RX)   |
| RX                 | GPIO1 (TX)   |
| GND                | GND          |
| 5V                 | 5V           |

Programming Mode:
- Connect GPIO0 to GND to enable programming mode.
- After uploading the code, disconnect GPIO0 from GND and press the reset button on the ESP32-CAM to start the program.

5. Optional Capacitor for Power Stabilization

To ensure stable power supply for servos, connect a 1000 ÂµF capacitor across the 5V and GND lines of the external power supply.

| Capacitor Pin | Connection  |
|---------------|-------------|
| Positive (+)  | 5V Line     |
| Negative (-)  | GND Line    |
